//! Subscriptions Solana Program.
//!
//! A token delegation program for SPL Token and Token-2022 that allows users to
//! grant scoped spending authority to third parties without transferring ownership.
//!
//! The program supports three delegation models:
//!
//! - **Fixed delegations** -- a one-time allowance with an optional expiry timestamp.
//! - **Recurring delegations** -- a periodic allowance that resets each period, with
//!   configurable period length and overall expiry.
//! - **Subscription plans** -- merchant-defined plans where subscribers grant recurring
//!   pull access; the merchant (or whitelisted pullers) can transfer funds each period.
//!
//! All delegation state is stored in Program Derived Accounts (PDAs). The program is
//! built on the [Pinocchio](https://docs.rs/pinocchio) runtime for minimal compute
//! overhead and uses [Codama](https://github.com/codama-idl/codama) for IDL generation.
